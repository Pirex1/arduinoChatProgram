# arduinoChatProgram
This is a simple chat program that allows two Arduinos to communicate via their serial ports. This program was  developed in two stages, the first was a simple unencrypted chat that allowed simple communication that displayed on two computers monitors. The second version implemented XOR encryption using the diffie-heilman procedure as well as adding better functionality.
